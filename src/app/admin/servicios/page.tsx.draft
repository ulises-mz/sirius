"use client";

import Link from "next/link";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { getServices } from "@/lib/cms-data"; // This won't work client-side directly if not via API
// Actually, we need to fetch via API for client components usually, 
// OR since we are using JSON files and this is a server component... wait.
// "use client" means we can't use node fs directly.
// We need to create the API endpoints FIRST to consume them, OR make this a Server Component.
// Let's make the main list page a Server Component to fetch data directly (since it's JSON read).
// But we want interactivity (delete buttons).
// Best pattern: Server Component fetches data, passes to Client Component list.

// Let's create the API endpoints first as planned in Phase 4? 
// No, I can make this page a Server Component and simple actions.
// But wait, "getServices" uses "fs" which is Node-only. 
// So yes, I cannot use "getServices" in a Client Component.
// I SHOULD make the page a Server Component.

// RE-WRITING AS SERVER COMPONENT
